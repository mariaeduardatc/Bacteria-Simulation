# Bacteria-Simulation

## Model Description
The model simulates bacterial growth based on a set of environmental parameters and governing rules, such as the mathematical relationships dictating how food and bacteria proliferate (detailed further below). The simulation takes place within a cellular automaton environment, where each cell contains varying amounts of bacteria and food. These cells interact with one another, leading to diverse emergent scenarios within the model.
